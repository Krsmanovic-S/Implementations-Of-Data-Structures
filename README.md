# C++ Implementation of the Linked List Data Structure

Supports singly and doubly linked lists that are implemented with the following features:

  * Append a node
  
  * Prepend a node
  
  * Remove tail node
  
  * Remove head node
  
  * Insert a node in a desired location
  
  * Remove a node from a desired location
  
  * Print all values in the list
  
The list and the nodes are templated, meaning that you can create lists of different types, however they must be the same (i.e list of only integers, only floats etc..). Every method and variable is documented with the XML documentation in Visual Studio.
