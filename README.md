The different structures are all **templated**, meaning that you can create them with different types, however they must be the same (i.e list of only integers, only floats etc..). Every method and variable is documented with the XML documentation in Visual Studio.

# Linked List

Supports singly and doubly linked lists that are implemented with the following features:

  * Append a node
  
  * Prepend a node
  
  * Remove tail node
  
  * Remove head node
  
  * Insert a node in a desired location
  
  * Remove a node from a desired location
  
  * Print all node values in the list
  
  * Use iterators for traversing from one node to the next
  
# N-ary Trees

Create and manipulate N-ary trees, where each node can have as many children as it wants. Features include:

* Add a child node to an existing one

* Insert a child node at a specific place

* Remove a child node at a specific index

* Preorder traversal

* Postorder traversal

* Print all node values in the tree

* Calculate the size of the tree (total nodes)

I have also included the **Graphviz** library here for generating the visual representation of the tree.
This library is used by first generating the dot file and then using it to produce a png file.

# Stack

Create and manipulate stacks with the following methods:

 * Push a new value onto the stack
 
 * Pop a value from the top of the stack
 
 * Get the value located at the top
 
 * Check whether a stack is empty or not
 
 * Print all values in the stack

 * Use iterators for travering the stack

# Queue

Create and manipulate queues with the following methods:

 * Push a new value onto the queue
 
 * Pop a value from the front of the queue
 
 * Get the value located at the front
 
 * Check whether a queue is empty or not
 
 * Print all values in the queue
 
 * Use iterators for travering the queue
